# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

Welcome to my project, where I explored key insights into Canada's real estate market using Tableau (option 1), a powerful data visualization tool. Our project delves into several crucial questions, each addressing a unique facet of the Canadian real estate landscape.

## Process

### Download the files and analysis for each one 

I got the files and made an analysis for each one. It helped me understand what data I would work with and create the graphs and visualizations.  
Please find the files on the data folder in this repository.

### Adding new columns and formatting

Tableau removed all null values for me.  
Transform JSON file ina CSV file.  
I added new columns to establish relationships between files.

## Results

**Question 1: Trends in House Prices Across Canada**

I began by uncovering the trends in house prices across Canada over the past four decades. To visualize this, I leveraged the "housing_price_index" data.

**Question 2: Post-2005 Trend Comparison with Benchmark Prices**

Next, I compared the trends in house prices after 2005 with the actual benchmark prices, as found in the "real_estate_prices" table. This helped us identify any differences and potential insights into market dynamics.

**Question 3: House Prices vs. Office Prices**

Our third inquiry focused on the relative growth rates of house prices and office prices. I analyzed which one is becoming more expensive and at what pace.

**Question 4: Creating a Canada Heatmap for Current House Prices Between Districts**

To gain a geographical perspective, I created a heatmap of Canada, color-coded to represent current house prices across different districts.

**Question 5: Comparing House Prices with Earnings**

Our next exploration involved comparing the trend of house prices with earnings. I assessed whether people were allocating a higher percentage of their earnings to housing in 2014 compared to 2001.

**Question 6: Did people spend more of their earnings in 2014 than they did in 2001?**

In 2014, the average expenditure as a percentage of earnings stood at 119.03, whereas in 2001, it was at 106.73. This data indicates a notable increase in spending as a proportion of earnings over the 13-year period. Therefore, it can be concluded that people allocated a larger portion of their earnings towards expenses in 2014 compared to 2001. This shift may be reflective of changes in economic conditions, lifestyles, or consumer behavior during this timeframe.  
**I used the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excluding food, energy, and the effect of indirect taxes as a key component in my analysis. This CPI measure excludes factors that are typically more volatile and subject to fluctuations, such as food and energy prices, and it also excludes the effect of indirect taxes.**

**Question 7: Impact of Economic Crises**

I evaluated the impact of four significant economic crises – Black Monday (1987), the early 1990s recession, the dot-com bubble (2000 - 2002), and the financial crisis (2007 - 2009) – on various economic indicators, including earnings, house prices, office prices, house constructions, and the consumer index.

**Question 8: Predicting Consumer Index from Housing Price Index**

Finally, I explored whether there is a predictive relationship between the consumer index and the housing price index by fitting a regression line between them.

Through visualizations, I aim to provide clear and insightful answers to these questions, shedding light on the dynamics of Canada's real estate market and its interaction with broader economic factors. Let's embark on this data-driven journey and uncover the stories that lie within the numbers.

## Challenges
While I had prior experience working with Tableau through various exercises, this project presented a unique set of challenges. However, it also underscored the incredible value of Tableau in the realm of data analysis.

Managing multiple files and datasets proved to be both rewarding and demanding. To answer specific project questions, I often found myself creating new files and consolidating data, necessitating meticulous attention to detail.

One notable challenge I encountered was an inconsistency between the consumer index and the house price index. In resolving this issue, I sought assistance, and while it led to receiving another dataset, it also meant revisiting and reworking a substantial portion of the analysis that I had previously completed.

These challenges, though demanding, reinforced the versatility and power of Tableau as a data analysis tool. They also highlighted the importance of adaptability and persistence in navigating complex data projects.

## Future Goals
If I Have More Time...

While I've presented some significant findings today, there are additional avenues I can explore if I have more time and resources at our disposal:

1. Deeper Analysis of Economic Impact: I could delve deeper into the economic implications of our findings. For instance, I can assess how changes in housing prices affect not only our Average Index Value but also broader economic indicators, such as consumer spending, mortgage rates, or even inflation.

2. Geospatial Analysis: Extending our analysis to include geospatial components could be immensely valuable. By examining how housing prices vary across different regions and districts, I could uncover localized trends and pinpoint areas of potential investment opportunities or risks.

3. Predictive Modeling: With additional time, I can explore predictive modeling. By incorporating historical data and considering various economic scenarios, I can develop models that forecast future trends in housing prices and their impact on our index value.

4. Market Segmentation: Segmentation analysis allows us to understand how different market segments respond to changes in housing prices. For example, I can analyze the impact on first-time homebuyers versus seasoned investors, providing tailored insights for various stakeholders.

5. Sentiment Analysis: Exploring sentiment analysis by incorporating social media data and public sentiment can offer a comprehensive view of market dynamics. This can help us gauge the public's perception of housing prices and their willingness to invest.

6. Regulatory Analysis: Understanding the regulatory environment is crucial. By examining how changes in real estate regulations, tax policies, or interest rates impact our index value, I can stay ahead of potential legislative changes that may affect our investments.

7. International Comparisons: To gain a broader perspective, I can extend our analysis to compare our findings with international real estate markets. This global context can provide valuable insights into the competitiveness of our market.
